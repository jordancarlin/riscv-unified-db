= Tool Version Management

UnifiedDB uses https://mise.jdx.dev/[mise] to manage tool versions consistently across
development environments and CI.

== Overview

Tool versions are defined in `.mise.toml` in the project root. This single configuration
file specifies versions for:

- **Ruby** - Required for the main tooling and gem libraries
- **Node.js** - Required for documentation generation (Antora, Asciidoctor plugins)
- **Python** - Required for linting, testing, and automation scripts

== Configuration Files

=== `.mise.toml`

The primary configuration file for tool versions. Example:

[source,toml]
----
[tools]
ruby = "3.4.8"
node = "20"
python = "3.12"
----

=== Legacy Support

For IDE compatibility, the following legacy version files are still supported:

- `.ruby-version` - Read by many Ruby IDEs and tools
- `.node-version` - Read by some Node.js tools
- `.python-version` - Read by some Python tools

Mise is configured with `legacy_version_file = true` to read these files if present.

== Container Environment

All UnifiedDB tools run inside a container (Docker, Podman, or Singularity) for consistency.
The container includes mise-managed tool versions, ensuring the same versions are used in:

- Local development (via `./do` commands)
- GitHub Actions CI
- VS Code devcontainer

=== Container Files

- `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` - Docker image definition
- `container.def` - Singularity definition (auto-generated from Dockerfile)
- `bin/.container-tag` - Version tag for the container

== Updating Tool Versions

To update a tool version:

1. Edit `.mise.toml` with the new version
2. Update `.ruby-version` if changing Ruby (for IDE compatibility)
3. Bump `bin/.container-tag` to trigger a container rebuild
4. Commit all changes; pre-commit will regenerate `container.def`

== Package Management

Package managers handle dependencies for each ecosystem:

- **Ruby gems**: `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`
- **Node packages**: `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- **Python packages**: `requirements.txt`

These files are separate from tool version management and define the
specific libraries used by UnifiedDB.
