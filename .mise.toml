# Mise configuration for unified tool version management
# https://mise.jdx.dev/
#
# This file consolidates all tool versions that were previously scattered across:
# - .ruby-version (still kept for IDE compatibility)
# - package.json (node version)
# - requirements.txt (python packages)
# - Dockerfile

[settings]
# Also read legacy .ruby-version, .node-version, .python-version files if present
legacy_version_file = true

[env]
# Enable Ruby YJIT for better performance
RUBY_YJIT_ENABLE = "1"

[tools]
# Ruby version (also in .ruby-version for IDE compatibility)
ruby = "3.4.8"

# Node.js version (Ubuntu 24.04 ships ~18.x, we specify explicitly)
node = "20"

# Python version (Ubuntu 24.04 ships 3.12)
python = "3.12"
